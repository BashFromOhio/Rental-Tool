'''

The code in the image you provided is setting up a logging system in Python. It imports the necessary modules, defines a log file name that includes the current datetime, creates a directory for the logs, and configures the logging settings. Here is the breakdown:

Importing Modules:

logging: for logging events
os: for interacting with the operating system, like creating directories
datetime: for getting the current date and time
Import Errors:

There is a typo in line 4 with a repeated from. It should be from root import from_root.
Log File Naming:

LOG_FILE: It's a string that will hold the name of the log file, formatted with the current date and time when the program is run.
Creating Log Directory:

log_dir: A string that defines the directory name where the log files will be stored.
os.makedirs(log_dir, exist_ok=True): This line ensures that the directory defined by log_dir exists. If it doesn't, os.makedirs will create it. exist_ok=True tells the function not to raise an error if the directory already exists.
Configuring Logging:

logging.basicConfig(...): This function is used to configure the logging. It takes several arguments:
filename=logs_path: The path to the log file, which is a combination of from_root(), log_dir, and LOG_FILE.
format: The format for the log messages, which includes placeholders for the time of the log message (asctime), the logger's name (name), the log level (levelname), and the log message itself (message).
level=logging.DEBUG: This sets the logging level to DEBUG, which means all messages at this level and above will be logged.
